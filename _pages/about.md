<!-- In 2022, I decided to create this blog to share and document my understaning of technology. Over past 10 years I have worked on various projects and assignments involving above technologies and realised that each time I have to setup a new service/project there is a need to refer some of the boiler plate code, what classes are named and how code is structured. Hence this blog was created to that I can easily refer to the task I have already accomplished. -->

Over the past 10 years I have worked on various projects and assignments involving above mentioned technologies and realised that it's not alwasys possible to remember all the approaches and techniques used to solve a problem. It is quite tedious and time consuming to search internet to find link to some article/document you referred months/years ago. Therefore I decided to create this blog to document and share my knowledge and learning experience.
